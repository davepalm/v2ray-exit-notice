<h1>This Is a V2Ray Exit Router</h1>

<p>Most likely you are reading this notice because you had some issue with
the traffic coming from this IP. This router runs V2Ray, which is
a tunneling tool providing privacy to people who need it most: average computer 
users. This router IP should be generating no other traffic unless it has been
compromised.</p>

<p>V2Ray sees use by many important segments of the population including 
whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall 
and oppressive censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the U.S. military, 
and law enforcement, just to name a few. While V2Ray is not designed for 
malicious computer users, it is true that they can use the tool for malicious 
ends. In reality, however, the actual amount of abuse is quite low. This is 
largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to
privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals
can and do build, sell, and trade far larger and more powerful tools than V2Ray
on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for 
easily accessible, censorship-resistant, private, anonymous communication 
trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily 
uncovered by traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and 
surveillance anyway.</p>

<p>In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand V2Ray is to consider 
it a router operating as a common carrier, much like the Internet
backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, V2Ray routers
explicitly do not log identifiable routing information about a packet. 
As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track
the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the V2Ray
traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or
illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to
seize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this machine may serve as a carrier of email, which means that
its contents are further protected under the ECPA. 18 USC 2707 explicitly 
allows for civil remedies ($1000 per account plus legal fees) in the event of a 
seizure executed without good faith or probable cause. It should be clear at 
this point that traffic with this originating IP address of should not 
constitute probable cause to seize the machine. Similar considerations exist 
for First Amendment content on this machine.</p>

<p>If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being
used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or
contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure
maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their
equipment, in accordance with DMCA safe harbor provisions. In other words, 
you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet 
backbone providers.</p>

<p>You have the option of blocking this IP address and others running V2Ray 
if you so desire. Please be considerate when using this option. 
It would be unfortunate to deny all V2Ray users access
to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.</p>
